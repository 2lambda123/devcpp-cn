README file for Dev-C++'s language files

There are three files for each language:
1. *.lng: User interface items. 
   You can create you own language file by make a copy of English.lng.
   Then do the translation by hands or with the help of Google translation.
   
2. *.tips: Tips of the day.
   You can create you own language file by make a copy of English.tips
   Many items have been revised since Dev-C++ v5.13. Please update them.

3. *.msg: Compiling message translation.
   You can create you own file by making a copy of Chinese.msg.
   The are English lines and translated text in the next line.
   Keep the English lines unchanged, just translate them in the next lines.
   
Besides, there are translation files (*.translate) in the "Templates" folder.
The file format is the same as *.msg file in this folder.


If you make some translation, please send them to my mailbox, so that I can 
include in the next release.
